# School-District-Analysis
## Purpose
We are combing through the school data to analyze any patterns between the scholar's standardized tests performance and their funding. With this analysis we are looking to help inform the school board on how funding correlates with math and reading scores. After being informed, we hope the school board members feel more secure on how to vote for the schools' budget. 

## Results
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data 
- 1st change
- 2nd
- 3rd
- 4th
- 5th
- 6th
- 7th

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced
