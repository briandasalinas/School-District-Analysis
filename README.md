# School-District-Analysis
## Purpose 

We are combing through the school data to analyze any patterns between the scholar's standardized tests performance and their funding. With this analysis we are looking to help inform the school board on how funding correlates with math and reading scores. After being informed, we hope the school board members feel more secure on how to vote for the schools' budget.  

  

## Results 

Having to drop the freshmen scores from Thomas High School impacted most of our data. Below is a list of all the effects the change in data caused: 

- The total amount of students dropped from 39,170 students to 38,709 students. 

- The budget for the schools stayed the same. 

- The average Math score increased by 1.35 points. 

- The average Reading score increased by 0.55 points. 

- The percentage of students passing Math increased by 5.7%. 

- The percentage of students passing Reading increased by 3.3%. 

- The percentage of students passing both Math and Reading increased by 7.1%. 

  

## Summary 

After replacing the reading and math scores from Thomas High School, we saw several changes in the data. The first change that occurred was the increase in the average scores for both math and reading. Due to the increase to the average scores, we then saw an increase in the percentage of passing for math, reading, and both.
